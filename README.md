As a key contributor to the development of a Social Network Simulation in C++, I designed and implemented a robust system to model user interactions, posts, comments, and friendships. Below are the highlights of my contributions:





Designed a Modular Social Network Architecture: Developed a comprehensive C++ application simulating a social media platform, incorporating user profiles, posts, comments, replies, and a news feed using data structures like linked lists, hash tables, min-heaps, and graphs to ensure efficient data management and scalability.



Implemented Dynamic User Interactions: Engineered features for adding friends, posting content, commenting, and replying, with a notification system to track user activities, enhancing user engagement and interaction flow within the simulated network.



Optimized Data Retrieval and Display: Utilized a hash table for fast user profile searches and a min-heap for prioritized news feed updates, ensuring quick access to user data and seamless display of posts and comments with nested replies.



Ensured Robust Error Handling and User Experience: Integrated input validation and error-checking mechanisms throughout the console-based interface, providing a user-friendly experience with clear menu-driven navigation and feedback for all operations.
